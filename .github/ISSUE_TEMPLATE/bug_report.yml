        Thanks for helping us improve!

        We're limited in our bandwidth for maintaining these stacks. As a team, we're currently focusing our efforts on ourselves. The good news is you can fork this stack, tweak it however you want, and start using it right away as a custom stack.

        If you still want to report a bug, please fill out this form. We can't promise a quick response, but hopefully, when we have the bandwidth to tackle these stacks again, we can take a look. Thanks!
